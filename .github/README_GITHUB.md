# Setting Up Your GitHub Repository

This document provides instructions for setting up this project on your own GitHub repository.

## Initial Setup

1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in
   - Click the "+" icon in the top right and select "New repository"
   - Name your repository (e.g., "dependency-health-dashboard")
   - Choose public or private visibility
   - Do not initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. Link your local repository to GitHub:
   ```bash
   # Add the GitHub repository as the origin remote
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/dependency-health-dashboard.git

   # Rename the default branch to main (optional but recommended)
   git branch -M main

   # Push your code to GitHub
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Continuous Integration (Optional)

You can set up GitHub Actions to automatically run tests and linting:

1. Create a `.github/workflows` directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   ```

2. Create a basic CI workflow file:
   ```bash
   # Create a new file for the CI workflow
   touch .github/workflows/ci.yml
   ```

3. Add the following content to `ci.yml`:
   ```yaml
   name: CI

   on:
     push:
       branches: [ main ]
     pull_request:
       branches: [ main ]

   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
       - uses: actions/checkout@v3
       - name: Use Node.js
         uses: actions/setup-node@v3
         with:
           node-version: '18.x'
           cache: 'npm'
       - run: npm ci
       - run: npm run build
       - run: npm run lint
   ```

## Deployment (Optional)

For easy deployment, you can use Vercel or Netlify:

### Vercel
1. Sign up for a [Vercel](https://vercel.com) account
2. Install the Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
3. Run `vercel` in your project directory and follow the prompts
4. For subsequent deployments, just run `vercel` again

### Netlify
1. Sign up for a [Netlify](https://netlify.com) account
2. Install the Netlify CLI: `npm i -g netlify-cli`
3. Run `netlify init` in your project directory and follow the prompts
4. For subsequent deployments, run `netlify deploy --prod`

## Collaboration

To collaborate with others:

1. Have collaborators fork your repository
2. They should clone their fork and make changes
3. They can submit pull requests from their fork to your main repository
4. You can review and merge their changes

## Keeping Your Repository Updated

Regularly update your dependencies:

```bash
# Check for outdated packages
npm outdated

# Update packages
npm update

# Or update a specific package
npm update package-name
```

## Next Steps

1. Customize the project to fit your specific needs
2. Add more features from the roadmap in the main README
3. Share your project with the community
4. Consider accepting contributions from others
